# online-Shoping-website
Our online shopping project combines frontend 
and backend development, using Node.js as the 
core technology for seamless integration. We 
employ modern web technologies, including 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a dynamic 
and responsive user interface. Through the 
frontend, users can easily navigate, search, filter, 
view product details, and add items to their 
shopping carts. The frontend communicates with 
the backend via secure API endpoints, ensuring 
reliable data transmission. Our platform prioritizes 
user privacy and data protection, while providing 
real-time responses and updates.
